<h1>Information</h1>
<p>(Sorry for the bad page, rehauling soon)</p>
<br> 
<p> The server is a city/town/village sort of role-play with a leader, a government, and normal things like jobs and stores. These are built by normal players, with materials they earned. </p>
</br>
<br>
 The server has multiple keys with bound R. If you have any, please re-bind or set it to NONE because of Modern Warfare. You should keep the Reload Key.</p>
